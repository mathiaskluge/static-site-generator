* Functionality
*
* Specific templates per content page
* -> specified in conten- frontmatter?
* -> general config in code
*
* Navigation and links
* -> there is likely a lot of basic stuff missing
*
* ===================================================================================
*
* Code Stuff
*
* Error Handling
* -> consistent, holistic approach with very useful feedback
* -> where: all file copying and processing (extension, location) and content processing
*
* Extract the shell prompting and logging out of core functions
* -> Potential approach: have copy, generate and generate_recursive 
* -> return a log to be used by dedicated shell prompting functions
*
* Combine processing of links and images
* -> extract_markdown_images & extract_markdown_links => extract_markdown_references
* -> split_nodes_image & split_nodes_link => split_nodes_references
*
* Brobably too much abstraction in markdown_to_html_node
* -> insert all the functions it calls into the cases for better 
* -> comprehention on what it does
*
