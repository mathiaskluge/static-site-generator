# static-site-generator
Purely educational, rudimentary static site generator to learn the concept.

To get started:

- copies files and folders from `/static` into `/public`
- generates pages from `/content` to `/public` using templates from `/template`
- spins up a simple webserver at `http://localhost:8888/`

```bash
./main.sh
```
